# GPX file analysis with Spark3
This is the source code for The Newbie Cloud Architect blog post [#031](https://tncad.blogspot.com/2020/06/031-gpx-analysis-with-spark3.html). 

## Description
The Scala application uses Apache Spark for processing and analysing GPX files generated by a fitness tracker / running watch. The idea is to calculate speed and automaticaly detect changes during an interval training. No Machine Learning algorithm is used at this point but this is planed for later.
